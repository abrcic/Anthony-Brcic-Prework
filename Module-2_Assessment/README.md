This is a JavaScript game I created guessing some cities in Croatia. Try to find out which city is the hidden eord by just typing on your keyboard. I gave 12 attempts because not everyone knows the cities in Croatia unless you are very familiar with the country. When you guess the city right you get to see a small beauty of the city. The game will keep score of how many times you win and what letters you have guessed. So far the high score is from a friend of mine with a score of 17. I hope you enjoy this game as much as my friend and learn some cities from a smaller country in Eurpoe.
